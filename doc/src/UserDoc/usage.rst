Checkout workflow
-----------------

The checkout process works according to the Magento速 standard behaviour:

* After entering the shipping address in the Magento速 checkout, the module retrieves
  the available DHL Express products, depending on the module configuration and the
  shipping destination.
* The available shipping methods will be displayed. If none are visible, have a look
  at the `Troubleshooting`_ hints.
* The customer can select the desired DHL Express product.

  displayed.

Creating a shipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workflow for creating a shipment is identical to the Magento速 standard behaviour.

**Note**: This does not create a DHL shipment request or packaging label! See the
section about `Creating shipments / labels`_ for more information.
