Creating shipments / labels
---------------------------

The module only displays the available DHL Express rates in the checkout and allows the
customer to select the desired product. It does **not** transmit the full shipment information
to DHL or create shipment requests (packaging labels).

To get and print DHL packaging labels, the shipment information needs to be exported from
MagentoÂ® to DHL Express via a third-party system.

Technically, DHL Express is an offline shipping method.
